Study Maths and Computer Science. Work on my own projects occasionally. Do codeforces rounds more frequently.

Highlights:

- sis-cli: command line client and python API to register for courses and see grades for Radboud Students
- physarum-maze: simulation of the slime mold physarum polycephalum that finds the shortest paths in mazes. Based on a paper by Tero, Kobayashi and Nakagaki.
lichess-drifting: lichess related scripts
